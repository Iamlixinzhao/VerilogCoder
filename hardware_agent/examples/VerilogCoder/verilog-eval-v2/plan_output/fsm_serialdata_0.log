You are a Verilog RTL designer that can break down complicated implementation into subtasks implementation plans.

[Example Begin]

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Example End]

[Target Problem]
### Problem 

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. 


[Instruction]
Let's think step by step. 
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 

- If the problem is related to sequential circuit waveform, analyze the waveform of clk and signals to identify flip-flop and latch first before complete the plans.
  If the signal changes when clock is active for more than a time point, it is a Latch.

- If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below. 
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "3",
                        "content": "task description 3",
                        "source": "source 3"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules! Do not make the plans that violate the following rules!!!
- Make a plan to define the module with its input and output first.
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code. 
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal.
- Don't make a plan on implementing the signal or next state logics which are not related to the module outputs.
- For module related to Finite State Machine (FSM), try to determine the number of states first and then make the plan to implement FSM.
- For module related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is a input signal, You must Do Not implement the state flip-flops for state transition as the example below in TopModule. 
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example]
  always@(*) begin
    ...
    state <= next_state;
    ...
  end

You are a Verilog RTL designer that identify the signals, state transition description, and signal example contents.

[Module Description]
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. 


[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- You must extract the signals and all signal examples in the description!
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch. 
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 |

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. 


[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Define the module TopModule with inputs clk, in, reset and outputs out_byte (8 bits), done.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.
```
Define the module TopModule with inputs clk, in, reset and outputs out_byte (8 bits), done.

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the

correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. 


[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Implement the logic to store the received bits into a shift register when in the receiving state. Shift the register with each clock cycle when receiving data.

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;

[Module Description]
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the start bit (0). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;

verilog_verification_assistant (to chat_manager):

The provided Verilog code has several issues and mismatches with the subtask requirements:

1. **State Transition Logic**: The code does not correctly handle the transition from the `RECEIVE` state to the `CHECK_STOP` state. It should transition after exactly 8 bits have been received, but the current logic might transition prematurely or too late because it does not reset the `bit_count` correctly in all cases.

2. **Data Buffer Handling**: The `data_buffer` should be filled from LSB to MSB according to the serial protocol, but the current indexing might not correctly reflect this requirement.

3. **Output Validity**: The `out_byte` should only be valid when `done` is 1. The current implementation sets `out_byte` directly in the `CHECK_STOP` state without ensuring `done` is set to 1 only when the stop bit is correct.

4. **Reset Handling**: The `done` signal should be reset to 0, but it is not explicitly reset in the reset condition.

5. **Error State Handling**: The transition from the `ERROR` state back to `IDLE` is correct, but the handling within the `ERROR` state might need more explicit actions to clear or reset states.

Here is the revised code with corrections:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic in,
    input  logic reset,
    output logic [7:0] out_byte,
    output logic done

    localparam IDLE = 3'b000;
    localparam RECEIVE = 3'b001;
    localparam CHECK_STOP = 3'b010;
    localparam ERROR = 3'b011;

    // State register
    logic [2:0] state;
    logic [2:0] next_state;

    // Data bit counter
    logic [3:0] bit_count;

    // Data storage
    logic [7:0] data_buffer;

    // FSM logic to handle state transitions and outputs
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            bit_count <= 0;
            data_buffer <= 0;
            done <= 0;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic for next state and output control
    always @(*) begin
        next_state = state; // Default to stay in current state
        done = 0; // Default done to 0
        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in == 0) begin
                    next_state = RECEIVE;
                end
            end
            RECEIVE: begin
                if (bit_count == 7) begin // Check if 8 bits have been received
                    next_state = CHECK_STOP;
                end
            end
            CHECK_STOP: begin
                if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                    done = 1;
                    out_byte = data_buffer;
                end else begin
                    next_state = ERROR;
                end
            end
            ERROR: begin
                if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
            end
        endcase
    end

    // Data reception logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (state == RECEIVE) begin
            data_buffer[bit_count] <= in;
            bit_count <= bit_count + 1;
        end else begin
            bit_count <= 0;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This code should now correctly handle the FSM transitions, data reception, and output validity as per the subtask requirements.

[Example Begin]

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Example End]

[Module Description]
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Current SubTask]
Implement the logic to store the received bits into a shift register when in the receiving state. Shift the register with each clock cycle when receiving data.

- in: input serial data bit
- reset: input active-high synchronous reset

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the start bit (0).

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.

[Example Begin]

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Current SubTask]
Implement the logic to check the stop bit after receiving the 8 data bits. Set the 'done' output to 1 if the stop bit is correct.

Retrieved Related Information:
- `in`: input serial data bit
- `out_byte`: output 8-bit data byte
- `done`: output signal indicating the completion of byte reception
- FSM starts in IDLE state, waiting for start bit (0).
- On detecting start bit (0), FSM transitions to RECEIVE state and starts receiving the next 8 data bits.
- After receiving 8 data bits, FSM checks for stop bit (1).
- If stop bit (1) is correct, `done` is set to 1, and FSM transitions back to IDLE state.
- If stop bit is not correct, FSM enters ERROR state and waits for a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
done is set to 1 after verify the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

[Module Description]
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Current SubTask]
Assign the contents of the shift register to the output 'out_byte' when 'done' is set to 1.

Retrieved Related Information:

- in: input serial data bit
- reset: input active-high synchronous reset
- out_byte: output 8-bit data byte

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
The module will also output the correctly-received data byte. 'out_byte' needs to be valid when 'done' is 1, and is don't-care otherwise (8'bx).

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;

[Current SubTask]
Implement the reset functionality to reset the FSM and the shift register when the reset input is asserted.

Retrieved Related Information:
- The module should have an input signal named "reset" which is an active-high synchronous reset.
- On detecting start bit (0), the FSM transitions to the RECEIVE state and starts receiving the next 8 data bits.
- After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for the stop bit (1).
- If the stop bit (1) is correct, the signal "done" is set to 1, and the FSM transitions back to the IDLE state.
- If the stop bit is not correct, the FSM enters the ERROR state and waits for a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
Include a active-high synchronous reset.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;

[TaskManager]: Executing  Task(description=Debugging and Fixing the waveform, expected_output=) 

user (to chat_manager):

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax and verify the functionality.

[Target Module Description]
### Problem 
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along 
with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the 
stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 
1 stop bit (1). The `in` stays at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted. 
The FSM should start to receive the following 8 data bits right after detect the 
start bit (0). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been 
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to start to receive the data 
right away when the start bit (0) occurs, receive the consecutive all 8 data bits, 
then verify that the stop bit (1) was correct of `in`. `done` is set to 1 after verify 
the stop bit (1), otherwise, it will be remain 0. The module will also output the 
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is 1, and is 
don't-care otherwise (8'bx). If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM 
enters error state and must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to 
receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial 
protocol `in` sends in a sequence from LSB to MSB. Assume all sequential logic 
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. 


### Completed Verilog Module
```verilog

module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic in,
    input  logic reset,
    output logic [7:0] out_byte,
    output logic done
);

    // State definitions
    localparam IDLE = 3'b000;
    localparam RECEIVE = 3'b001;
    localparam CHECK_STOP = 3'b010;
    localparam ERROR = 3'b011;

    // State register
    logic [2:0] state;
    logic [2:0] next_state;

    // Data bit counter
    logic [3:0] bit_count;

    // Data storage
    logic [7:0] data_buffer;

    // FSM logic to handle state transitions and outputs
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            bit_count <= 0;
            data_buffer <= 0;
            done <= 0;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic for next state and output control
    always @(*) begin
        next_state = state; // Default to stay in current state
        done = 0; // Default done to 0
        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in == 0) begin
                    next_state = RECEIVE;
                end
            end
            RECEIVE: begin
                if (bit_count == 7) begin // Check if 8 bits have been received
                    next_state = CHECK_STOP;

                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
            end
        endcase
    end

    // Data reception logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (state == RECEIVE) begin
            data_buffer <= {in, data_buffer[7:1]}; // Shift register operation
            bit_count <= bit_count + 1;
        end else begin
            bit_count <= 0;
        end
    end

endmodule

```


[Instructions]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.

### Mismatched signals time(ns) Trace After the First Mismatch End ###


[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, in, reset)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

verilog_engineer (to chat_manager):

The waveform trace indicates that the `done` signal is set incorrectly at time 95 ns when it should remain 0. The issue occurs because the `done` signal is set to 1 in the `CHECK_STOP` state without ensuring that all 8 bits have been correctly received and the stop bit is verified.

In the current implementation, the transition from `RECEIVE` to `CHECK_STOP` occurs when `bit_count` equals 7, which is incorrect because the bit count should reach 8 to ensure all bits are received. The `bit_count` should be checked against 8 instead of 7 before transitioning to `CHECK_STOP`.

Let's correct the code by adjusting the condition for transitioning from `RECEIVE` to `CHECK_STOP` and ensure that `done` is set correctly based on the complete reception of the byte and the correct stop bit.

### Mismatched signals time(ns) Trace After the First Mismatch End ###


[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, in, reset)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

verilog_engineer (to chat_manager):

The waveform trace indicates that the `done` signal is set incorrectly at time 105 ns when it should be 1, but it remains 0. This issue arises because the transition from the `RECEIVE` state to the `CHECK_STOP` state is based on the `bit_count` reaching 8, but the `bit_count` is incremented after the data is shifted into `data_buffer`. This results in the `CHECK_STOP` state being entered one clock cycle too late, causing the `done` signal to be set incorrectly.

To fix this, we need to adjust the condition for incrementing the `bit_count` and transitioning to the `CHECK_STOP` state. The `bit_count` should be incremented before checking if it has reached 8, and the transition to `CHECK_STOP` should occur when `bit_count` equals 7 (since it will be incremented to 8 in the same cycle).

### Mismatched signals time(ns) Trace After the First Mismatch End ###


[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, in, reset)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

verilog_engineer (to chat_manager):

The waveform trace reveals that the `done` signal is set incorrectly at 95 ns when it should be 0, but it is 1. This error occurs because the `done` signal is set to 1 in the `CHECK_STOP` state when `in` is 1, but it does not account for the transition back to the `IDLE` state before setting `done` back to 0.

To correct this, we need to ensure that the `done` signal is only set to 1 for one clock cycle when the stop bit is correctly received and then reset to 0 in the next clock cycle as the FSM transitions back to the `IDLE` state.
