[Target Problem]
### Problem 


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]
Let's think step by step.
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 
If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below. 
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "3",
                        "content": "task description 3",
                        "source": "source 3"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules! Do not make the plans that violate the following rules!!!
- Make a plan to define the module with its input and output first.
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code. 
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal.
- Don't make a plan on implementing the signal or next state logics which are not related to the module outputs.
- For module related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is a input signal, You must Do Not implement the state flip-flops for state transition as the example below in TopModule. 
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example]
  always@(*) begin
    ...
    state <= next_state;
    ...
  end
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example End]
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), and during active high period of clock for latch.
  Flip-Flops only changes the signal during clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge), and Latch changes the signal during clock is 1.
  [Latch with Active High of Clock Example]
  always @(*)
    if (clock)
      latch = din; # transparent when clock is 1
  [Latch with Active High of Clock Example End]

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- You must extract the signals and all signal examples in the description!
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch. 
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Define the TopModule with input clk, input reset, and output q (32 bits).
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.
```
Define the TopModule with input clk, input reset, and output q (32 bits).

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Implement the wrapping right shift logic for the MSB tap position at q[31] where it is q[0] XORed with 1'b0.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.
```
Implement the wrapping right shift logic for the MSB tap position at q[31] where it is q[0] XORed with 1'b0.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule

  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out

      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;

    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Previous Module Implementation]
```verilog

module TopModule (
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  output logic [31:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      q <= 32'h1;
    end else begin
      q <= {q[30:0], q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]};
    end
  end

endmodule

```

[Current SubTask]
```
Implement the shift register logic for the output q[31:1] where each bit position without a tap shifts right.

Retrieved Related Information:
On each positive edge of clk, if reset is not active, the LFSR shifts right. (Type:StateTransition)
```


[Referenced SubTask Description]:
bit positions without a tap shift right

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

The provided Verilog code correctly implements the subtask requirement. The XOR logic for the tap positions at q[31], q[21], q[1], and q[0] is implemented as specified, with each of these positions being XORed with q[0] to produce their next value. The MSB (q[31]) is also correctly implemented as the result of q[0] XORed with 1'b0, which is effectively just q[0] since XOR with 0 does not change the value.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  output logic [31:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      q <= 32'h1;

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Previous Module Implementation]
```verilog

module TopModule (
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  output logic [31:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      q <= 32'h1;
    end else begin
      // Shift register logic for the output q[31:1] where each bit position without a tap shifts right
      q[31:1] <= {q[30:22], q[21] ^ q[0], q[20:2], q[1] ^ q[0], q[0]};
      // The LSB q[0] is updated with the XOR of the tap positions and itself
      q[0] <= q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0];
    end
  end

endmodule

```

[Current SubTask]
Implement the wrapping right shift logic for the MSB tap position at q[31] where it is q[0] XORed with 1'b0.



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
tap position at the MSB bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

[Target Module Description]
### Problem 

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



### Completed Verilog Module
```verilog

module TopModule (
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  output logic [31:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      q <= 32'h1;
    end else begin
      // Shift register logic for the output q[31:1] where each bit position without a tap shifts right
      // The MSB q[31] is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0
      q[31:1] <= {q[0] ^ 1'b0, q[30:22], q[21] ^ q[0], q[20:2], q[1] ^ q[0]};
      // The LSB q[0] is updated with the XOR of the tap positions and itself
      q[0] <= q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0];
    end
  end

endmodule

```


[Instructions]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

The waveform trace indicates that there are mismatches in the output `q` starting from the first clock cycle after the reset is deasserted. The mismatches are due to incorrect initialization and propagation of the LFSR values. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the LFSR taps and the wrapping of the MSB.

### Identified Issues:
1. The MSB `q[31]` is supposed to be the result of `q[0]` wrapped around, but it is incorrectly XORed with `1'b0`, which is redundant since XOR with `0` does not change the value. It should directly take the value of `q[0]`.
2. The taps are not correctly handled. The LFSR taps are at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The tap at position 32 (i.e., `q[31]`) should wrap around to `q[0]`, and the other taps should XOR with `q[0]` to produce their next values.

### Corrected Verilog Module:
```verilog
module TopModule (
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  output logic [31:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      q <= 32'h1;
    end else begin
      // Correctly handle the LFSR taps and wrapping of the MSB
      q[31] <= q[0]; // MSB is the wrap-around of LSB
      q[30:22] <= q[31:23]; // Shift the bits between tap positions
      q[21] <= q[22] ^ q[0]; // Tap at position 22
      q[20:2] <= q[21:3]; // Shift the bits between tap positions
      q[1] <= q[2] ^ q[0]; // Tap at position 2
      q[0] <= q[1] ^ q[0]; // Tap at position 1
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This corrected module should now correctly implement the 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps and wrapping behavior. Let's verify this corrected module using the simulation tool.
