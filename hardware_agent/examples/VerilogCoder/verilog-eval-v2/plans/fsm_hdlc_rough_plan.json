Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a \"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 counting. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing \"flags\" in the wrong position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 counting. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. When receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to monitor the next consecutive value 1 pattern from input in from the beginning state.", "parent_tasks": ["3"]}, {"id": "5", "content": "Implement the output logic for the FSM to assert the disc, flag, and err signals based on the current state.", "source": "Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).", "parent_tasks": ["4"]}]
