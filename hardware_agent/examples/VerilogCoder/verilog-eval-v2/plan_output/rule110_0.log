You are a Verilog RTL designer that can break down complicated implementation into subtasks implementation plans.

[Target Problem]
### Problem 


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  load
 - input  data (512 bits)
 - output q    (512 bits)

The module should implement Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular
automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).
There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step,
the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell
depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following
table:

  Left[i+1] | Center[i] | Right[i-1] | Center's next state 
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1
  1    | 0      | 1     | 1
  1    | 0      | 0     | 0
  0    | 1      | 1     | 1
  0    | 1      | 0     | 1
  0    | 0      | 1     | 1
  0    | 0      | 0     | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and switch by one
time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input
indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. 
The Right boundary of q[0] bit is 0 and the Left boundary of q[511] is 0. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]
Let's think step by step.
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 
If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below. 
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "3",
                        "content": "task description 3",
                        "source": "source 3"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules! Do not make the plans that violate the following rules!!!
- Make a plan to define the module with its input and output first.
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code. 
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal.
- Don't make a plan on implementing the signal or next state logics which are not related to the module outputs.
- For module related to Finite State Machine (FSM), try to determine the number of states first and then make the plan to implement FSM.
- For module related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is a input signal, You must Do Not implement the state flip-flops for state transition as the example below in TopModule. 
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example]
  always@(*) begin
    ...
    state <= next_state;
    ...
  end
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example End]
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), and during active high period of clock for latch.
  Flip-Flops only changes the signal during clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge), and Latch changes the signal during clock is 1.
  [Latch with Active High of Clock Example]
  always @(clock) begin
      latch = din; # transparent when clock is 1
  end

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  load
 - input  data (512 bits)
 - output q    (512 bits)

The module should implement Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular
automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).
There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step,
the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell
depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following
table:

  Left[i+1] | Center[i] | Right[i-1] | Center's next state 
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1
  1    | 0      | 1     | 1
  1    | 0      | 0     | 0
  0    | 1      | 1     | 1
  0    | 1      | 0     | 1
  0    | 0      | 1     | 1
  0    | 0      | 0     | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and switch by one
time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input
indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. 
The Right boundary of q[0] bit is 0 and the Left boundary of q[511] is 0. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- You must extract the signals and all signal examples in the description!
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch. 
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

The module should implement Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular
automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).
There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step,
the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell
depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following
table:

  Left[i+1] | Center[i] | Right[i-1] | Center's next state 
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1
  1    | 0      | 1     | 1

  0    | 0      | 1     | 1
  0    | 0      | 0     | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and switch by one
time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input
indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. 
The Right boundary of q[0] bit is 0 and the Left boundary of q[511] is 0. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;

verilog_verification_assistant (to chat_manager):

The provided Verilog code for the subtask "Implement the 512-bit register to hold the state of the cellular automaton, which will be loaded with the input data when load is high" is mostly correct, but it lacks handling for the case when `load` is not high. The register `q` should maintain its state when `load` is not asserted.

Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       load,
  input  logic [511:0] data,
  output logic [511:0] q
);

  // 512-bit register to hold the state of the cellular automaton
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      q <= data;
    end else begin
      q <= q; // Maintain the current state when load is not high
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This modification ensures that the register `q` retains its value across clock cycles unless `load` is asserted, in which case it loads new data from `data`. This behavior is essential for proper operation of the cellular automaton as described in the task.

verilog_verification_assistant (to chat_manager):

The provided Verilog code attempts to implement the combinational logic for the Rule 110 cellular automaton within a sequential always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. However, there are several issues and mismatches with the task requirements and Verilog best practices:

1. **Combinational Logic in Sequential Block**: The Rule 110 logic is implemented inside a sequential always block, which is not appropriate. The combinational logic should be separated from the sequential logic to correctly model the behavior of the cellular automaton.

2. **Incorrect Use of Non-blocking Assignments**: The use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) inside the combinational logic is incorrect. For combinational logic, blocking assignments (`=`) should be used.

3. **Modification of Loop Variable**: The code attempts to modify `q[i]` directly within the loop, which can lead to simulation and synthesis issues due to multiple drivers in a single always block.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions are correctly handled, but the implementation method could be optimized.

To correct these issues, the combinational logic should be moved to a separate always block or implemented using continuous assignments. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```verilog
module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       load,
  input  logic [511:0] data,
  output logic [511:0] q
);

  logic [511:0] next_q;

  // 512-bit register to hold the state of the cellular automaton
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      q <= data;
    end else begin
      q <= next_q;
    end
  end

  // Combinational logic for Rule 110
  always @(*) begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
      logic left, center, right;
      center = q[i];
      if (i == 0) begin
        right = 0; // Boundary condition
        left = q[i+1];
      end else if (i == 511) begin
        left = 0; // Boundary condition
        right = q[i-1];
      end else begin
        left = q[i+1];
        right = q[i-1];
      end

      // Rule 110 logic
      case ({left, center, right})
        3'b111: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
        3'b110: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b101: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b100: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
        3'b011: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b010: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b001: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b000: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
      endcase
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This version separates the combinational logic into its own always block and uses a separate register `next_q` to hold the next state, which is then assigned to `q` in the sequential block. This approach adheres to best practices for separating combinational and sequential logic in Verilog.

[TaskManager]: Executing  Task(description=Implement the sequential logic to update the state of the cellular automaton at each positive edge of the clock, using the combinational logic from the previous step.Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock., expected_output=) 

user (to chat_manager):

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax based on the task definition.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
[Example End]

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  load
 - input  data (512 bits)
 - output q    (512 bits)

The module should implement Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular
automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).
There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step,
the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell
depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following
table:

  Left[i+1] | Center[i] | Right[i-1] | Center's next state 
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1
  1    | 0      | 1     | 1
  1    | 0      | 0     | 0
  0    | 1      | 1     | 1
  0    | 1      | 0     | 1
  0    | 0      | 1     | 1
  0    | 0      | 0     | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and switch by one
time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input
indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. 
The Right boundary of q[0] bit is 0 and the Left boundary of q[511] is 0. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Current SubTask]
Implement the sequential logic to update the state of the cellular automaton at each positive edge of the clock, using the combinational logic from the previous step.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

user (to chat_manager):

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax and verify the functionality.

[Target Module Description]
### Problem 

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  load
 - input  data (512 bits)
 - output q    (512 bits)

The module should implement Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular
automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).
There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step,
the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell
depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following
table:

  Left[i+1] | Center[i] | Right[i-1] | Center's next state 
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1
  1    | 0      | 1     | 1
  1    | 0      | 0     | 0
  0    | 1      | 1     | 1
  0    | 1      | 0     | 1
  0    | 0      | 1     | 1
  0    | 0      | 0     | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and switch by one
time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input
indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. 
The Right boundary of q[0] bit is 0 and the Left boundary of q[511] is 0. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



### Completed Verilog Module
```verilog

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       load,
  input  logic [511:0] data,
  output logic [511:0] q
);

  logic [511:0] next_q;

  // 512-bit register to hold the state of the cellular automaton
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      q <= data;
    end else begin
      q <= next_q;
    end
  end

  // Combinational logic for Rule 110
  always @(*) begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
      logic left, center, right;
      center = q[i];
      if (i == 0) begin
        right = 0; // Boundary condition
        left = q[i+1];
      end else if (i == 511) begin
        left = 0; // Boundary condition
        right = q[i-1];
      end else begin
        left = q[i+1];
        right = q[i-1];
      end

      // Rule 110 logic
      case ({left, center, right})
        3'b111: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
        3'b110: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b101: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b100: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
        3'b011: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b010: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b001: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
        3'b000: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
      endcase
    end
  end

endmodule

```


[Instructions]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.
