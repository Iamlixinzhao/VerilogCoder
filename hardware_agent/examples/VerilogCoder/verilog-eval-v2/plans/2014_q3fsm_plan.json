You can define pre_w is the previous_w value, and pre_pre_w is the pre_w value, so using (pre_pre_w & pre_w & !w) matches w = 1 -> 1 -> 0 in these three clock cycles to determine the next state. In state Z, the input w value is monitored and then FSM goes to state B1 after a clock cycle in state Z.
