[Example Begin]

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Target Problem]
### Problem 


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]
Let's think step by step. 
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 

- If the problem is related to sequential circuit waveform, analyze the waveform of clk and signals to identify flip-flop and latch first before complete the plans.
  If the signal changes when clock is active for more than a time point, it is a Latch. 
- You can use sequential_flipflop_latch_identify_tool example only when there is a simulation waveform provided in the prompt. Do not generate your own waveform to use the tool.

- If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below. 
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "3",
                        "content": "task description 3",
                        "source": "source 3"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules! Do not make the plans that violate the following rules!!!
- Make a plan to define the module with its input and output first.
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code. 
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal.
- Don't make a plan on implementing the signal or next state logics which are not related to the module outputs.
- For module related to Finite State Machine (FSM), try to determine the number of states first and then make the plan to implement FSM.
- For module related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is a input port signal of the module, You must Do Not implement the state flip-flops for state transition as the example below in TopModule.

    ...
    state <= next_state;

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- You must extract the signals and all signal examples in the description!
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch. 
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Define the Verilog module TopModule with inputs clk, resetn, x, y and outputs f, g. This setup will serve as the foundation for implementing the FSM logic.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Implement the reset functionality within the state transition logic to ensure that the FSM returns to the initial state when resetn is active. This should be handled synchronously with the clock.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active,

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value.

  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM advances again to monitor the x input. When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t to define the parameter. Use `localparam` or Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

    a = b;

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Current SubTask]
Implement the reset functionality within the state transition logic to ensure that the FSM returns to the initial state when resetn is active. This should be handled synchronously with the clock.

Retrieved Related Information:
- clk: Clock input
- resetn: Synchronous reset input, active low
- f: Output to control the motor
- When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle.
- FSM advances again to monitor the x input.
- If FSM detects the first x=1 value, then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise the next state of FSM remains in the same state.
- When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains in the same state.

- As long as the resetn input is active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A.



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
As long as the resetn input is active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t to define the parameter. Use `localparam` or Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end

user (to chat_manager):

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax and verify the functionality. 
You need to run the verilog_simulation_tool to make sure the functional correctness before TERMINATE.

[Target Module Description]
### Problem 

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the resetn input is
active, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM advances 
to another state to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle and then FSM 
advances again to monitor the x input. If FSM detects the first x=1 value, 
then the FSM will go to next state to detect the following x=0 value, otherwise 
the next state of FSM remains in the same state. 
When detecting x=0 value, FSM goes to next state to detect the last x=1 which 
need to be sent right after a clock cycle, otherwise next state of FSM remains 
in the same state. 
When the last x=1 is detected, g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle, 
otherwise the FSM goes back to the state to detect the first x=1 value. 
When g is set to 1 after received the last x=1, the FSM starts to monitor the y input 
within the following two clock cyles as described below.
- In the first clock cycle when setting g to 1, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters 
  to another the state that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, 
  otherwise, FSM start to check the y in the second clock cycle.
- In the second clock cycle, if the y becomes value 1, then the FSM enters to the state 
  that should maintain g = 1 forever until input resetn is active, otherwise, FSM enters 
  to another new state that set g = 0 forever until input resetn is active.
In the above two clock cycles monitering y, the output g should remains 1. 

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

```


[Instructions]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
