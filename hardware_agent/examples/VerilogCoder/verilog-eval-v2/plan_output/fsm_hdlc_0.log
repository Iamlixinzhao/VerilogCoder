You are a Verilog RTL designer that can break down complicated implementation into subtasks implementation plans.

[Example Begin]

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Target Problem]
### Problem 


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock 
cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the 
FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM 
goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs 
to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags" in the wrong 
position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When 
receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert 
disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. 
If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. 
Wehn receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state 
and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, 
on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to moniter the next consecutive value 1 
pattern from input in from the beginning state.
Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]
Let's think step by step. 
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 

- If the problem is related to sequential circuit waveform, analyze the waveform of clk and signals to identify flip-flop and latch first before complete the plans.
  If the signal changes when clock is active for more than a time point, it is a Latch. 
- You can use sequential_flipflop_latch_identify_tool example only when there is a simulation waveform provided in the prompt. Do not generate your own waveform to use the tool.

- If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below. 
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },

                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules! Do not make the plans that violate the following rules!!!
- Make a plan to define the module with its input and output first.
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code. 
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal.
- Don't make a plan on implementing the signal or next state logics which are not related to the module outputs.
- For module related to Finite State Machine (FSM), try to determine the number of states first and then make the plan to implement FSM.
- For module related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is a input port signal of the module, You must Do Not implement the state flip-flops for state transition as the example below in TopModule. 
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example]

    ...
    state <= next_state;
    ...

plan_verify_assistant (to chat_manager):

The plan provided is well-structured and aligns with the user's instructions to implement a module named TopModule with specific functionalities based on the HDLC framing protocol. The subtasks are logically ordered and focus on defining the module, determining the number of states, implementing state transition logic, and output logic for the FSM. Each subtask is sourced from the problem description, ensuring relevance and clarity.

However, there is a minor issue in subtask 3 which violates the rules specified in the instruction. The rule states that for modules related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is an input port signal of the module, the implementation of state flip-flops for state transition should not be planned. Since the state is not an input port signal in this case, the plan to implement state transition logic using a state register is valid.

Overall, the plan adheres to the rules and instructions provided. Therefore, the response is:

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock 
cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the 
FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM 
goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs 
to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags" in the wrong 
position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When 
receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert 
disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. 
If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. 
Wehn receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state 
and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, 
on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to moniter the next consecutive value 1 
pattern from input in from the beginning state.

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- You must extract the signals and all signal examples in the description!
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch. 
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0

  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock 
cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the 
FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM 
goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs 
to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags" in the wrong 
position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When 
receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert 
disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. 
If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. 
Wehn receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state 
and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, 
on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to moniter the next consecutive value 1 
pattern from input in from the beginning state.
Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Define the module TopModule with inputs clk, reset, in and outputs disc, flag, err. All ports should be one bit.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.
```
Define the module TopModule with inputs clk, reset, in and outputs disc, flag, err. All ports should be one bit.

2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax based on the task definition.

[Example Begin]

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock 
cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the 
FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM 
goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs 
to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags" in the wrong 
position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When 
receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert 
disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. 
If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. 
Wehn receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state 
and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, 
on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to moniter the next consecutive value 1 
pattern from input in from the beginning state.
Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
input  clk
input  reset
input  in
output disc
output flag
output err

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t to define the parameter. Use `localparam` or Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;

When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to monitor the next consecutive value 1 pattern from input in from the beginning state.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock 
cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the 
FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM 
goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs 
to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags" in the wrong 
position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When 
receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert 
disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. 
If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. 
Wehn receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state 
and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, 
on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to moniter the next consecutive value 1 
pattern from input in from the beginning state.
Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t to define the parameter. Use `localparam` or Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

    a = b;

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock 
cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the 
FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM 
goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs 
to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags" in the wrong 
position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When 
receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert 
disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. 
If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. 
Wehn receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state 
and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, 
on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to moniter the next consecutive value 1 
pattern from input in from the beginning state.
Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t to define the parameter. Use `localparam` or Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock 
cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the 
FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM 
goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs 
to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags" in the wrong 
position, the sender inserts a 0 after every 5 consecutive value 1. When 
receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert 
disc output. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. 
If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.
We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive value 1. 
Wehn receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state 
and assert `err` to 1. When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, 
on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to moniter the next consecutive value 1 
pattern from input in from the beginning state.
Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Current SubTask]
Implement the output logic for the FSM. The outputs disc, flag, and err should be driven based on the current state of the FSM.

Retrieved Related Information:
- reset: Active high synchronous reset
- in: Input data bit stream
- disc: Signal to discard a bit
- flag: Signal the beginning/end of a frame
- err: Signal an error for 7 or more consecutive 1s
- After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal.
- After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1.
- If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 counting.
- When receiving a 0 after 5 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to disc state to assert disc output.
- If in=1 at disc state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 counting.
- When receiving a 1 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to error state and assert `err` to 1.
- When in error state, the FSM will remain in error state when in=1, on the other hand, if in=0, the FSM goes back to monitor the next consecutive value 1 pattern from input in from the beginning state.



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive value 1 (i.e., 01111110) is a 'flag' that indicate frame boundaries and the FSM set flag to 1 for a clock cycle. After receiving the last 0 after receiving 6 consecutive value 1, the FSM goes to flag state and assert flag signal. After a clock cycle, the FSM goes back to recount the consecutive value 1. If in=1 at flag state, the 1 needs to be added to the next consecutive 1 couting.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t to define the parameter. Use `localparam` or Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.

  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Instructions]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.

[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, reset, in)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

verilog_engineer (to chat_manager):

The waveform trace indicates that the `disc` signal is not being asserted when it should be. The issue seems to be related to the transition from the `FIVE` state to the `DISCARD` state, which is not properly handled in the current state machine design.

In the current implementation, the state transitions from `SIX` to either `ERROR` or `FLAG`, but there is no transition to `DISCARD` when a `0` is received after `FIVE` consecutive `1`s. This needs to be corrected to handle the case where a `0` is received after `FIVE` consecutive `1`s, which should transition to the `DISCARD` state and assert the `disc` output.

### Correction Plan:
- Modify the state transition from `FIVE` to include a transition to `DISCARD` when `in` is `0`.
- Ensure that the `disc` output is asserted in the `DISCARD` state.

### Updated Verilog Code:
```verilog

    input  logic clk,

    localparam IDLE = 3'b000,
               ONE = 3'b001,

               SIX = 3'b110,
               DISCARD = 3'b111,
               FLAG = 4'b1000,
               ERROR = 4'b1001;

    // State register
    logic [3:0] state, next_state;

    // Count register
    logic [2:0] count;

    // Sequential logic for state transition

            state <= IDLE;
            count <= 0;

                count <= count + 1;
            else
                count <= 0;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        next_state = state; // Default to hold state
        case (state)

        endcase
    end

    // Output logic
    always @(*) begin
        disc = (state == DISCARD);
        flag = (state == FLAG);
        err = (state == ERROR);
