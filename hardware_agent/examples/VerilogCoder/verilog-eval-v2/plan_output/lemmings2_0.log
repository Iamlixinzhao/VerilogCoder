You are a Verilog RTL designer that can break down complicated implementation into subtasks implementation plans.

[Target Problem]
### Problem 


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.



[Instruction]
Let's think step by step.
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 
If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below. 
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "3",
                        "content": "task description 3",
                        "source": "source 3"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules! Do not make the plans that violate the following rules!!!
- Make a plan to define the module with its input and output first.
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal.
- Don't make a plan on implementing the signal or next state logics which are not related to the module outputs.
- For module related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is a input signal, You must Do Not implement the state flip-flops for state transition as the example below in TopModule. 
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example]
  always@(*) begin
    ...
    state <= next_state;
    ...
  end

```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
plan_verify_assistant (to chat_manager):

The provided plan has several issues that need to be addressed to align with the user instructions and the rules specified:

1. Subtask 2 is not necessary because we should not plan the implementation of state encoding explicitly as per the rules. The state encoding will be implicitly defined when we implement the state transition and output logic.

2. Subtask 3 is not aligned with the rules because it plans to implement state transition logic, which is not directly related to the module outputs. Instead, we should focus on the output logic that reflects the state transitions.

3. Subtask 6 is redundant because the logic to maintain the walking direction during a fall is already covered by the output logic that needs to be implemented in subtask 4.

4. Subtask 9 is not necessary because it describes a condition that should be inherently covered by the correct implementation of the state machine logic in subtasks 4, 5, and 7.

Here is the modified plan that addresses these issues:

```json
{
    "subtasks": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "content": "Define the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs.",
            "source": "input clk, input areset, input bump_left, input bump_right, input ground, output walk_left, output walk_right, output aaah"
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "content": "Implement the output logic for walk_left and walk_right based on the current state and bump inputs.",
            "source": "if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left."
        },
        {
            "id": "3",
            "content": "Implement the logic for the aaah output when the ground disappears and maintain it until the ground reappears.",
            "source": "when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say 'aaah!'. When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall."
        },
        {
            "id": "4",
            "content": "Implement the asynchronous reset logic to set the Lemming to walk left on areset.",
            "source": "areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left."
        }
    ]
}
```

This modified plan should now be in line with the user instructions and the rules provided. If this plan is acceptable, we can proceed with the implementation. Otherwise, further modifications can be made.

plan_verify_assistant (to chat_manager):

It appears there was a misunderstanding. The JSON format is not a language to be executed but a way to structure the plan. The error message indicates an attempt to execute JSON as if it were a programming language, which is not correct.

Let's correct the plan according to the user instructions and rules, without attempting to execute it. Here is the revised plan:

            "source": "if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left."
        },
        {
            "id": "3",
            "content": "Implement the logic for the aaah output when the ground disappears and maintain it until the ground reappears.",
            "source": "when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say 'aaah!'. When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall."
        },
        {
            "id": "4",
            "content": "Implement the asynchronous reset logic to set the Lemming to walk left on areset.",
            "source": "areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left."

}
```

This plan should now be correct according to the user instructions and rules. If the plan is good enough, we can proceed with the implementation. Otherwise, please provide further instructions.

specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right

on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than

Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.



[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- You must extract the signals and all signal examples in the description!
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Define the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.
```
Define the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs.

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Implement the logic for the aaah output when the ground disappears and maintain it until the ground reappears.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax based on the task definition.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

 - input  ground

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.

- If walking right and bump_right is 1, then transition to walking left state.
- Being bumped while ground is 0 does not change the walking direction.
- Being bumped when the ground reappears while still falling does not affect the walking direction.
- Being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears does not affect the walking direction.

if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left., expected_output=)

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
[Example End]

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.



[Previous Module Implementation]
```verilog

module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic areset,
    input  logic bump_left,
    input  logic bump_right,
    input  logic ground,
    output logic walk_left,
    output logic walk_right,
    output logic aaah
);
    // The internal logic and state machine will be defined here in subsequent tasks.
endmodule

```

[Current SubTask]
Implement the output logic for walk_left and walk_right based on the current state and bump inputs.

Retrieved Related Information:
- If areset is 1, then transition to walking left state.
- If walking left and bump_left is 1, then transition to walking right state.
- If walking right and bump_right is 1, then transition to walking left state.
- Being bumped while ground is 0 does not change the walking direction.
- Being bumped when the ground reappears while still falling does not affect the walking direction.
- Being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears does not affect the walking direction.



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end

It appears there was an error due to the use of the `typedef enum` construct without an explicit cast. I will correct the code by removing the `typedef enum` and using `localparam` to define the states, which should resolve the casting issue.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

    end

endmodule

```

[Current SubTask]
Implement the logic for the aaah output when the ground disappears and maintain it until the ground reappears.

Retrieved Related Information:
- If ground is 0, then output aaah is 1 (Type:StateTransition)



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say 'aaah!'. When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

    input  logic areset,
    input  logic bump_left,
    input  logic bump_right,
    input  logic ground,
    output logic walk_left,
    output logic walk_right,

            WALK_RIGHT: next_state = (bump_right && ground) ? WALK_LEFT : (ground ? WALK_RIGHT : FALL_RIGHT);
            FALL_LEFT: next_state = ground ? WALK_LEFT : FALL_LEFT;

            default: next_state = WALK_LEFT;
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic for aaah
    always @(*) begin
        // The aaah output should be high when the Lemming is falling
        // which is represented by the FALL_LEFT and FALL_RIGHT states.
        aaah = (state == FALL_LEFT || state == FALL_RIGHT);

    // Output logic for walking direction
    always @(*) begin

```

[Current SubTask]
Implement the asynchronous reset logic to set the Lemming to walk left on areset.

Retrieved Related Information:
- areset: input asynchronous reset signal, positive edge triggered (Type:Signal)
- If areset is 1, then transition to walking left state (Type:StateTransition)



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end

[Target Module Description]
### Problem 

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left) when walking left, it will switch 
to walking right state. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on 
bump_right) when walking right, it will switch to walking left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground 
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction 
as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than 
once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being 
bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when 
the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Instructions]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.

### Mismatched signals time(ns) Trace After the First Mismatch End ###


[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, areset, bump_left, bump_right, ground)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

verilog_engineer (to chat_manager):

The waveform trace indicates that the outputs `walk_left` and `walk_right` are not behaving as expected when the Lemming is in the falling state. Specifically, `walk_left` should be 0 when the Lemming is falling (as indicated by `ground` being 0), but it remains 1. This discrepancy starts at 105 ns and continues in subsequent cycles where the Lemming is in the falling state.

The issue seems to be with the output logic for `walk_left` and `walk_right` during the falling states. The current implementation incorrectly maintains the walking outputs even when the Lemming is falling. This needs to be corrected to ensure that both `walk_left` and `walk_right` are set to 0 during the falling states.

### Corrected Verilog Module
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic areset,
    input  logic bump_left,
    input  logic bump_right,
    input  logic ground,
    output logic walk_left,
    output logic walk_right,
    output logic aaah
);

    // State definitions
    localparam WALK_LEFT = 2'b00,
               WALK_RIGHT = 2'b01,
               FALL_LEFT = 2'b10,
               FALL_RIGHT = 2'b11;

    // State variables
    reg [1:0] state, next_state;

    // State transition logic with asynchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            state <= WALK_LEFT;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            WALK_LEFT: next_state = (bump_left && ground) ? WALK_RIGHT : (ground ? WALK_LEFT : FALL_LEFT);
            WALK_RIGHT: next_state = (bump_right && ground) ? WALK_LEFT : (ground ? WALK_RIGHT : FALL_RIGHT);
            FALL_LEFT: next_state = ground ? WALK_LEFT : FALL_LEFT;
            FALL_RIGHT: next_state = ground ? WALK_RIGHT : FALL_RIGHT;
            default: next_state = WALK_LEFT;
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic for aaah
    always @(*) begin
        aaah = (state == FALL_LEFT || state == FALL_RIGHT);
    end

    // Output logic for walking direction
    always @(*) begin
        walk_left = (state == WALK_LEFT);
        walk_right = (state == WALK_RIGHT);
    end

endmodule
```

I will now use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the corrected Verilog module.
