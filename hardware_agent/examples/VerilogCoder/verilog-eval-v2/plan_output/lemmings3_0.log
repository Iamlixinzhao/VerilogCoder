You are a Verilog RTL designer that can break down complicated implementation into subtasks implementation plans.

[Target Problem]
### Problem 


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.




[Instruction]
Let's think step by step.
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 
If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below. 
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "3",
                        "content": "task description 3",
                        "source": "source 3"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules! Do not make the plans that violate the following rules!!!
- Make a plan to define the module with its input and output first.
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code. 
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal.
- Don't make a plan on implementing the signal or next state logics which are not related to the module outputs.
- For module related to Finite State Machine (FSM), try to determine the number of states first and then make the plan to implement FSM.
- For module related to Finite State Machine or Moore State Machine, if the state or current_state is a input signal, You must Do Not implement the state flip-flops for state transition as the example below in TopModule. 
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example]
  always@(*) begin
    ...
    state <= next_state;
    ...
  end
  [State flip-flops for Transition Block Example End]
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), and during active high period of clock for latch.
  Flip-Flops only changes the signal during clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge), and Latch changes the signal during clock is 1.
  [Latch with Active High of Clock Example]
  always @(clock) begin
      latch = din; # transparent when clock is 1
  end
  [Latch with Active High of Clock Example End]

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.




[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- You must extract the signals and all signal examples in the description!
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch. 
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.




[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Define the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.
```
Define the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs.

useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.




[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Determine the number of states required for the FSM based on the Lemmings' behaviors.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan.

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.




[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Implement the asynchronous reset logic to set the FSM to the initial state of walking left.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

user (to chat_manager):

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax based on the task definition.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
[Example End]

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left or walking right. It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle... In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
[Example End]

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax based on the task definition.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
[Example End]

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say 'aaah!'. When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0).

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

verilog_verification_assistant (to chat_manager):

The provided Verilog code already implements the state transition logic for digging when the dig command is given and ground is present, as specified in the current subtask. The code correctly handles the transition to the digging states (`DIG_LEFT` and `DIG_RIGHT`) when the `dig` input is high and `ground` is 1, while the Lemming is in either the `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT` states.

Here is the relevant part of the code that addresses the subtask:

```verilog
WALK_LEFT: begin
    if (!ground)
        next_state = FALL_LEFT;
    else if (dig)
        next_state = DIG_LEFT;
    else if (bump_left)
        next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
    else
        next_state = WALK_LEFT;
end
WALK_RIGHT: begin
    if (!ground)
        next_state = FALL_RIGHT;
    else if (dig)
        next_state = DIG_RIGHT;
    else if (bump_right)
        next_state = WALK_LEFT;
    else
        next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
end
```

This code correctly prioritizes falling over digging and switching directions, as specified in the module description. The digging state persists until the ground disappears (`ground=0`), at which point the Lemming transitions to the corresponding falling state (`FALL_LEFT` or `FALL_RIGHT`).

Therefore, the code correctly implements the described functionality for the current subtask. Here is the complete module code:

If a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right.
If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.
When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.
The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0).
At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again.
Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status before fall.
Being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored.
If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.
areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous resetting the Lemming machine to walk left.
When ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say 'aaah!'.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction.
Being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears, or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Lemmings can be in the states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1)., expected_output=)

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
Lemmings can be in the states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1).

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

- A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0).
- At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again.
- Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status before fall.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say 'aaah!'.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
verilog_verification_assistant (to chat_manager):

The provided Verilog code already implements the output logic for `aaah` when the Lemming is falling as specified in the subtask. The relevant part of the code is:

```verilog
// Output logic
always @(*) begin
    walk_left = (state == WALK_LEFT);
    walk_right = (state == WALK_RIGHT);
    aaah = (state == FALL_LEFT || state == FALL_RIGHT);
    digging = (state == DIG_LEFT || state == DIG_RIGHT);
end
```

Here, the `aaah` output is correctly set to high (`1`) when the state is either `FALL_LEFT` or `FALL_RIGHT`, which corresponds to the Lemming falling. This matches the subtask requirement of setting `aaah` when the Lemming is falling.

Therefore, no modifications are needed, and the code correctly implements the described functionality.

If a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right.
If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.
When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.
The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status when fall.
A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0).
Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right status before fall.
Being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored.
If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.
areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous resetting the Lemming machine to walk left.
When ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say 'aaah!'.
At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again.
Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction.
Being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears, or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0)., expected_output=)

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0).

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Referenced SubTask Description]:
areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, you must use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end
  [if example end]
  
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.

[Target Module Description]
### Problem 

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in the states: walking left 
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. The fall (ground=0) status can be consecutively 
more than once, Lemming need to remain the walking left or walking right 
status when fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. Lemming need to 
remain the walking left or walking right status before fall. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

[Instructions]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- For simulation waveform, if it is a sequential circuit, be attention to the output and input signal transitions at clock edge (0 -> 1 posedge, or 1-> 0 negedge for flip-flops), or during active high period of clock for latch.
