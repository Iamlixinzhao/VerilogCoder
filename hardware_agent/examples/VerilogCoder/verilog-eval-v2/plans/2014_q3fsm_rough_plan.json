Assume that the FSM begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below. The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the next three clock cycles. You can use state B for monitoring the input w in the first cycle, state B1 for monitoring the input w in the second cycle, and so on. If the combinations of input w are w = 1 -> 1 -> 0, w = 1 -> 0 -> 1, or w = 0 -> 1 -> 1 in these three clock cycles (i.e., exactly two w=1), output z is set to 1 for the following cycle. You can define pre_w is the previous_w value, and pre_pre_w is the pre_w value, so using (pre_pre_w & pre_w & !w) matches w = 1 -> 1 -> 0 in these three clock cycles to determine the next state. In state Z, the input w value is monitored and then FSM goes to state B1 after a clock cycle in state Z.
