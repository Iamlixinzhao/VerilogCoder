You are a Verilog RTL designer that can break down complicated implementation into subtasks implementation plans.

[Target Problem]
### Problem 


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output start_shifting

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]
Let's think step by step.
Based on the Problem description, set up a sequential implementation plans. Each subtask should focus on implement only one signal at a time. 
Extract the corresponding source contexts in the [Target Problem] section of each subtask into the 'source' field. 
If the 'source' is a part of K-map, you must extract the corresponding row or column. Below is an example of extracting a row or a column in K-map.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 | 
  1,0 | 0 |
  ```
   
[K-map Table Example End]
 
The task id number indicates the sequential orders. Return the subtasks in json format as below.
```json
{
    "subtasks": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "content": "task description 1",
                        "source": "source 1"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "content": "task description 2",
                        "source": "source 2"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "3",
                        "content": "task description 3",
                        "source": "source 3"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
}

```

[Rules]
Make sure the task plans satisfy the following rules!
- Do not plan the implementation of logic or signal from the input ports.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. Do not plan generating testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Don't make a plan only with clock or control signals. The clock or control signals should be planned with register or wire signal. 
- For Finite State Machine related problems, if the state is a input signal, which means the state is controlled by other circuit components, Do not implement the state and next state transition logic block in this module!
- Make sure to define the types of state first before implement any logic block related to Finite State Machine.

You are a Verilog RTL designer that identify the signals, state transition description, and signal example contents.

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output start_shifting

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.



[Instruction]

Extract the signal and its description, state transition description, and signal example contents in the json format.
The return format need to follow ```json and ``` format. 
```json
{
  "signal": ["<signal1 name>: <signal1 description>", "<signal2 name>: <signal2 description>", ...], # list of strings
  "state_transitions_description": [<state_transition_line1>, <state_transistion_line2>, ...], # list of strings
  "signal_examples": [<text1>, <text2>, ...], # list of strings
}
```

[Rules]:
- Do not implement the verilog code. Do not change the original description and text.
- Do not change the state_transition format when extracting to 'state_transitions_description'.
- If the state_transition is represented as K-map table, you need to extract the row or column values with their corresponding row or column signals.
- Do not add signal examples if there is no examples in the module description.

[Hint]
For K-map Table below, you should read it in row based or column based based on the module description.
[K-map Table Example]:
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0 
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  1,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  
  [Extract Row (c,d) = (1,1)]
  ```
  The output row is below
             a,b
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  1,1 | d | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  ```
  
  [Extract Column (a,b) = (1,0)]
  ```
  The output column is below. 
       a,b
  c,d  1,0  
  0,0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 0 | 
  1,1 | 1 |

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output start_shifting

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Define the state types for the finite-state machine. Create an enumerated type for the states which include IDLE, S1, S2, S3, and FOUND to represent the states of detecting each bit of the sequence 1101.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.
```
Define the state types for the finite-state machine. Create an enumerated type for the states which include IDLE, S1, S2, S3, and FOUND to represent the states of detecting each bit of the sequence 1101.

You are a top-tier Verilog expert with experience in retrieving required information for the following plan using retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool. 
[Module Description]:

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output start_shifting

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.



[Current Plan Description]: 
```
Implement a state register to hold the current state of the FSM. This register should be updated on the positive edge of the clock and should be reset to the IDLE state when the reset signal is active high.
```

Let's think step by step. 
1. Set BFS_retrival_level=2.
2. Use retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool to retrieve the required information. The rules for covering the plan are below.
   - have the signal mentioned in the plan
   - Must have the signal example if there are any related to the plan
3. Increase the BFS_retrival_level by 1 and repeat the step 2. BFS_retrival_level should not exceed 10. 
   - If the plan is well covered by the retrieved information or no more retrieved information available, go to Step 4.
4. Compile the node names and descriptions which covers the plan from the BFS result.
   - You must remove the signal which is not mentioned in the plan. Make the related information short and be able to cover the plan need.
   - Must include the signal example (Type: SignalExample) if the signal is mentioned in the plan.

Return the Plan and retrieved related information from retrieve_additional_plan_information_tool.
If there is no retrieved related information needed for the the plan, just return the Plan. 
The return format is below.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )
      reg_out <= 0;
    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  logic [7:0] temp_wire;

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output start_shifting

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.



[Previous Module Implementation]
N/A

[Current SubTask]
Define the state types for the finite-state machine. Create an enumerated type for the states which include IDLE, S1, S2, S3, and FOUND to represent the states of detecting each bit of the sequence 1101.

Retrieved Related Information:
- start_shifting: Output signal that is set to 1 when the sequence 1101 is found in the input data stream (Type:Signal)
- When the sequence 1101 is found, start_shifting is set to 1, forever, until reset. (Type:StateTransition)



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;

The provided Verilog code defines the state types for the finite-state machine using an enumerated type as requested in the current subtask. However, the rules specify not to use `state_t`. Instead, you should use `reg` or `logic` for signals as registers or Flip-Flops. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog

  localparam [2:0] IDLE  = 3'b000, // Idle state, looking for '1'

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out

  end

  // Combinational logic

[Current SubTask]
```
Implement a state register to hold the current state of the FSM. This register should be updated on the positive edge of the clock and should be reset to the IDLE state when the reset signal is active high.

Retrieved Related Information:
clk: Clock input (Type:Signal)
reset: Reset input, active high synchronous (Type:Signal)
When the sequence 1101 is found, start_shifting is set to 1, forever, until reset. (Type:StateTransition)
```


[Referenced SubTask Description]:
Reset is active high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end

data: Input data bit stream (Type:Signal)
When the sequence 1101 is found, start_shifting is set to 1, forever, until reset. (Type:StateTransition)
```


[Referenced SubTask Description]:
The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.

  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;

The provided Verilog code has a mismatch in the next state logic for the FSM. Specifically, the transition from state S2 to S3 is incorrect. According to the subtask, the FSM should transition from S2 to S3 on detecting '0', but the code incorrectly transitions from S2 to S2 on detecting '1' and to S3 on detecting '0'. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic data,
  output logic start_shifting
);

  // State types for the finite-state machine
  localparam IDLE  = 3'b000, // Idle state, looking for '1'
             S1    = 3'b001, // Found first '1'
             S2    = 3'b010, // Found '11'
             S3    = 3'b011, // Found '110'

        next_state = data ? S2 : IDLE;
      end
      S2: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : S3; // This line is incorrect
        // Correct transition should be:
        next_state = data ? S3 : S1; // Transition to S3 on '1', back to S1 on '0'
      end
      S3: begin
        next_state = data ? FOUND : S1; // Transition to FOUND on '1', back to S1 on '0'

user (to chat_manager):

You are a Verilog RTL designer that only writes code using correct Verilog syntax based on the task definition.

[Example Begins]
### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer. The 8-bit
input is first registered and then incremented by one on the next cycle.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
output to zero.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       reset,
  input  logic [7:0] in,
  output logic [7:0] out
);

  // Sequential logic

  logic [7:0] reg_out;

  always @( posedge clk ) begin
    if ( reset )

    else
      reg_out <= in;
  end

  // Combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    temp_wire = reg_out + 1;
  end

  // Structural connections

  assign out = temp_wire;
endmodule

### Problem

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a finite-state machine that takes as input a
serial bit stream and outputs a one whenever the bit stream contains two
consecutive one's. The output is one on the cycle _after_ there are two
consecutive one's.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock. The reset input is active high synchronous and should reset the
finite-state machine to an appropriate initial state.

### Solution

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic in,
  output logic out
);

  // State enum

  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;
  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;
  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;

  // State register

  logic [1:0] state;
  logic [1:0] state_next;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ( reset ) begin
      state <= STATE_A;
    end else begin
      state <= state_next;
    end
  end

  // Next state combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    state_next = state;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
      STATE_C: state_next = ( in ) ? STATE_C : STATE_A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output combinational logic

  always @(*) begin
    out = 1'b0;
    case ( state )
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
  end

endmodule

[Module Description]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output start_shifting

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.



[Previous Module Implementation]

module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic data,
  output logic start_shifting
);

  // State types for the finite-state machine
  localparam IDLE  = 3'b000, // Idle state, looking for '1'
             S1    = 3'b001, // Found first '1'
             S2    = 3'b010, // Found '11'
             S3    = 3'b011, // Found '110'
             FOUND = 3'b100; // Found '1101', sequence complete

  // State variables
  reg [2:0] state, next_state;

  // State register
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      state <= IDLE;
    end else begin
      state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  // Next state logic
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      IDLE: begin
        next_state = data ? S1 : IDLE;
      end
      S1: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : IDLE;
      end
      S2: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : S3; // Transition to S3 on '0', stay in S2 on '1'
      end
      S3: begin
        next_state = data ? FOUND : S1; // Transition to FOUND on '1', back to S1 on '0'
      end
      FOUND: begin
        next_state = FOUND; // Once FOUND, stay in this state until reset
      end
      default: begin
        next_state = IDLE;
      end
    endcase
  end

  // Rest of the FSM implementation will be here

endmodule


[Current SubTask]
Implement the output logic for the start_shifting signal. This signal should be set to '1' when the current state is FOUND. It should remain '1' until the FSM is reset.

Retrieved Related Information:
- start_shifting: Output signal that is set to 1 when the sequence 1101 is found in the input data stream (Type:Signal)
- When the sequence 1101 is found, start_shifting is set to 1, forever, until reset. (Type:StateTransition)



[Referenced SubTask Description]:
When the sequence is found, it should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset.

[Hints]:
- For implementing kmap, you need to think step by step. Find the inputs corresponding to output=1, 0, and don't-care for each case. Categorized them and find if there are any combinations that can be simplify.  

[Rules]:
- Only write the verilog code for the [Current SubTask]. Don't generate code without defined in the [Current SubTask].
- Don't change or modify the code in [Previous Module Implementation].
- Return the written verilog log code with Previous Module Implementation. 
- Declare all ports and signals as logic.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.
- Define the parameters or signals first before using them.
- Not all the sequential logic need to be reset to 0 when reset is asserted.    
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign (i.e., assign wire = a ? 1:0;) or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
- For 'if' block, always use begin and end as below.
  [if example]
  if (done) begin
    a = b;
    n = q;
  end

### Problem 

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.

[Hints]:
1. Use the verilog_simulation_tool to verify the syntax and functional correctness of the Completed Verilog Module.
2. Use the waveform_trace_tool to trace the waveform and partial verilog code of functional incorrect signals.
3. Debug the waveform and verilog source code and find out the signals need to be corrected.
4. Repeat above steps until pass the syntax and functional check.

[Constraints]:
- Do not use typedef enum in the verilog code.
- There is test bench to test the functional correctness. You don't need to generate testbench to test the generated verilog code.
- Do not use $display or $finish in the module implementation.
- You can not modify the testbench.
- Declare all ports as logic; use wire or reg for signals inside the block.
- Don't use state_t. Use 'reg' or 'logic' for signals as registers or Flip-Flops.
- for combinational logic, you can use wire assign or always @(*).
- for combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*)
- Don't generate duplicated signal assignments or blocks.

### Mismatched signals time(ns) Trace After the First Mismatch End ###


[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, reset, data)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

verilog_engineer (to chat_manager):

The waveform trace indicates that the `start_shifting` signal does not transition to 1 at the correct time. The mismatch occurs at 45ns, where `start_shifting_dut` remains 0 while `start_shifting_ref` transitions to 1. This suggests an issue with the timing or condition under which `start_shifting` is set to 1.

Upon reviewing the code, the issue seems to be related to the timing of setting `start_shifting`. The output `start_shifting` is set based on the state being `FOUND`, but it is only checked and updated at the positive edge of the clock. This could potentially delay the output response by one clock cycle, which seems to be the case here.

To resolve this, we can modify the output logic for `start_shifting` to update immediately when the state transitions to `FOUND`, rather than waiting for the next clock edge. This can be achieved by moving the logic to a combinational always block.

Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic data,
  output logic start_shifting
);

  // State types for the finite-state machine
  localparam IDLE  = 3'b000, // Idle state, looking for '1'
             S1    = 3'b001, // Found first '1'
             S2    = 3'b010, // Found '11'
             S3    = 3'b011, // Found '110'
             FOUND = 3'b100; // Found '1101', sequence complete

  // State variables
  reg [2:0] state, next_state;

  // State register
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      state <= IDLE;
    end else begin
      state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  // Next state logic
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      IDLE: begin
        next_state = data ? S1 : IDLE;
      end
      S1: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : IDLE;
      end
      S2: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : S3; // Transition to S3 on '0', stay in S2 on '1'
      end
      S3: begin
        next_state = data ? FOUND : S1; // Transition to FOUND on '1', back to S1 on '0'
      end
      FOUND: begin
        next_state = FOUND; // Once FOUND, stay in this state until reset
      end
      default: begin
        next_state = IDLE;
      end
    endcase
  end

  // Output logic for start_shifting
  always @(*) begin
    if (reset) begin
      start_shifting = 1'b0;
    end else if (state == FOUND) begin
      start_shifting = 1'b1;
    end else begin
      start_shifting = 1'b0;
    end
  end

[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, reset, data)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

The waveform trace shows that the `start_shifting` signal does not reset properly when the `reset` signal is high. The issue seems to be related to the synchronous reset behavior of the `start_shifting` signal. The reset condition needs to be checked at the positive edge of the clock to ensure synchronous reset behavior.

Here's the corrected code with the synchronous reset for the `start_shifting` signal:

```verilog
module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic data,
  output logic start_shifting
);

  // State types for the finite-state machine
  localparam IDLE  = 3'b000, // Idle state, looking for '1'
             S1    = 3'b001, // Found first '1'
             S2    = 3'b010, // Found '11'
             S3    = 3'b011, // Found '110'
             FOUND = 3'b100; // Found '1101', sequence complete

  // State variables
  reg [2:0] state, next_state;

  // State register
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      state <= IDLE;
    end else begin
      state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  // Next state logic
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      IDLE: begin
        next_state = data ? S1 : IDLE;
      end
      S1: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : IDLE;
      end
      S2: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : S3; // Transition to S3 on '0', stay in S2 on '1'
      end
      S3: begin
        next_state = data ? FOUND : S1; // Transition to FOUND on '1', back to S1 on '0'
      end
      FOUND: begin
        next_state = FOUND; // Once FOUND, stay in this state until reset
      end
      default: begin
        next_state = IDLE;
      end
    endcase
  end

  // Output logic for start_shifting
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      start_shifting <= 1'b0;
    end else if (state == FOUND) begin
      start_shifting <= 1'b1;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This modification ensures that `start_shifting` is reset synchronously with the clock when the reset signal is high. Let's run the simulation tool again with this updated code.

### Mismatched signals time(ns) Trace After the First Mismatch End ###


[Note] You can not change the [testbench input signal]: (clk, reset, data)! Modify the module implementation considering the input signals.
[Hint] Firstly, identify the time of mismatched signals, and only focus on the mistmatched signals in the waveform firstly.Then, explain the related signals and their transitions in the waveform table. Don't correct signals without mismatch in the table waveforms.If the information is not enough for correct the functional error, try to trace more relevant signals using trace_level >2 for waveform_trace_tool.If you know how to correct the functional error, start to correct the code and run verilog_simulation_tool again.

The waveform trace indicates that the `start_shifting` signal does not correctly transition to `1` at the expected time of 45 ns. Instead, it remains `0` when it should have transitioned to `1` as per the reference waveform. This mismatch occurs right after the state transitions to `FOUND` (state 4).

The issue seems to be related to the timing of the output signal `start_shifting` update in relation to the state transitions. The output signal should be updated immediately when the state transitions to `FOUND`.

Here's the corrected code with immediate update of `start_shifting` when the state transitions to `FOUND`:

```verilog
module TopModule
(
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  input  logic data,
  output logic start_shifting
);

  // State types for the finite-state machine
  localparam IDLE  = 3'b000, // Idle state, looking for '1'
             S1    = 3'b001, // Found first '1'
             S2    = 3'b010, // Found '11'
             S3    = 3'b011, // Found '110'
             FOUND = 3'b100; // Found '1101', sequence complete

  // State variables
  reg [2:0] state, next_state;

  // State register
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      state <= IDLE;
      start_shifting <= 1'b0; // Reset start_shifting synchronously
    end else begin
      state <= next_state;
      if (next_state == FOUND) begin
        start_shifting <= 1'b1; // Set start_shifting immediately when FOUND
      end
    end
  end

  // Next state logic
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      IDLE: begin
        next_state = data ? S1 : IDLE;
      end
      S1: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : IDLE;
      end
      S2: begin
        next_state = data ? S2 : S3; // Transition to S3 on '0', stay in S2 on '1'
      end
      S3: begin
        next_state = data ? FOUND : S1; // Transition to FOUND on '1', back to S1 on '0'
      end
      FOUND: begin
        next_state = FOUND; // Once FOUND, stay in this state until reset
      end
      default: begin
        next_state = IDLE;
      end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

This modification ensures that `start_shifting` is set to `1` immediately when the state transitions to `FOUND`, aligning with the expected behavior. Let's run the simulation tool again with this updated code.
